## Overview and goals
This is my personal portfolio website. 

I developed this site with a few goals in mind:
1) to have a place to host the full-stack projects I've been developing over the past few months
2) to practice using GatsbyJS, as its a front-end framework that I'm really interested in
3) to get more experience deploying sites using Netlify.

I also wanted the site to be fully responsive and look great on both desktop and mobile. With that in mind, I took a mobile-first approach to development.

## What I learned
I learned a ton through this project! One example: I had never had any exposure to GraphQL before, but Gatsby's responsive image plugin requires embedding GraphQL queries in different components. After a lot of reading, I managed to get it working well, and improved the site's performance significantly. 

## Future features
Beyond adding additional projects as I develop them, I would love to add a dark mode to the site.

## Acknowledgements
I looked at a ton of portfolio examples while working on this project. Two that I found particularly useful were [this site](https://fredrikridderfalk.github.io/) by Frerik Ridderfalk (which also has an amazing ReadMe) and [this Gatsby portfolio template](https://gatsby-simplefolio.netlify.app/) by Jacobo Mart√≠nez.
