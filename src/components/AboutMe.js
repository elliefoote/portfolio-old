        My career journey has taken me from Melbourne to Barcelona, and from social policy to English teaching to software development. Many elements of software development are a great fit for my skills, including my love of solving problems and my drive to constantly learn new things. 
        <br /><br />
        On the front end, I love working with React.js, and I make everything look beautiful using HTML, vanilla CSS, and frameworks like Bootstrap. On the back end, I use Node.js and Express.js. When Iâ€™m building static sites (like this one!), I love using Gatsby.js.
